This document describes the *MPI for Python* package.  *MPI for
Python* provides bindings of the *Message Passing Interface* (MPI)
standard for the Python programming language, allowing any Python
program to exploit multiple processors.
	       
This package is constructed on top of the MPI-1/2 specifications and
provides an object oriented interface which closely follows MPI-2 C++
bindings. It supports point-to-point (sends, receives) and collective
(broadcasts, scatters, gathers) communications of any *picklable*
Python object, as well as optimized communications of Python object
exposing the single-segment buffer interface (NumPy arrays, builtin
bytes/string/array objects)
